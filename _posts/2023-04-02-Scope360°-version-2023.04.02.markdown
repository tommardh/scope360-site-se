## Plan Perspective

- Persistance of report configuration are optimized.
- Issue fields are added to issue details view and the issues are sorted in the same way as in issue details views in other parts of Scope360°.
- Left issuebar made more bold so it is clearer where one issue starts and another ends.

- Statuscategory coloring is now more solid, including in Links - Sometimes issues appeared black in Links or status appeared without color.


## Generic

- Uses of browser storage is moved one step away from using synced storage in the browser. This is a preparation to move all caching functionality to browsers local storage and session storage.
- Refactorings and improvements of the code base.
