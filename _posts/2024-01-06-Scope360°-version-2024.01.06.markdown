- Corrected bug that made headers and values to be misaligned in csv export
- Export as csv via [custom issue export](/release-note/2023/01/31/Scope360-version-2023.01.31.html) added. Config example:

```javascript
    {
        name: 'PI22.49 PD Priority',
        sortBy: ['id', 'program'],
        fields: ['id', 'program', 'iteration'],
        outputFormat: 'csv',
    };
```

## Plan Perspective

- Viz migrated to till vue3
- Removed flickering in Analyze Flow button
- Corrected config service to support hosts with port again
- Scope360° menu now available on issues page in Jira Cloud showing issue opened from search result
