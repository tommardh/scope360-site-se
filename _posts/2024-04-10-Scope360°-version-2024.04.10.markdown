## General

- New Scope360° log and icon in extension

![logo](/assets/images/logos/scope360logo.svg)

## Confluence perspective

- If a text containing issue keys, is copied, it can be pasted as a issue key query. This update provides a better filter for valid keys pasted. Can be used to select a part of a Confluence page containing links to Jira issues, copy and then use Scope360° to paste as issuekey query.
