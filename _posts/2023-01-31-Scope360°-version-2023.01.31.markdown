Example of a config file for custom exports:

```text
[
    {
        "name":"Priority List",
        "sortBy":["rank"],
        "fields":[
            "id",
            "summary",
            "program",
            "iteration"
        ],
        "outputFormat":"csv"
    },
    {
        "name":"Program List",
        "sortBy":["id","program"],
        "fields":[
            "id",
            "summary",
            "program",
            "iteration"
