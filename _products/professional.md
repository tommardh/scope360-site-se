# Dear user of Scope360° Professional,

Our aim with the Scope360° is to make your work day easier and that you become more efficient.
Every year we spend hundreds of hours improving Scope360°. The work includes everything from analysing needs and develop new functions in the product that can create great value for You. In order to be at the forefront and meet expectations, we have released many features.

Examples of features:

- **[Query Expansions](/release-note/2024/04/25/Scope360-version-2024.04.25.html)** - expand queries when opening Analyze plan
- **[Custom Export](/release-note/2023/01/31/Scope360-version-2023.01.31.html)** - Custom exports can be made from Jira
- **[Issue Details View](/release-note/2023/04/02/Scope360-version-2023.04.02.html)** - view issues inside Scope360°
- **[Dependency Board](/release-note/2023/01/31/Scope360-version-2023.01.31.html)** - Next generation of the program board is evolving

So far, this work has been completely voluntary and the time we spend has been in our own free time. We are passionate about our product and there is so much work ahead so that we can continue to create the new features we see are needed and in demand.

In time we will have to charge a little bit for You to keep using Scope360°. We are sure that it will be worth it! But til then we hope You will explore and enjoy all the new features Scope360° gives You!

Thank you for the trust!

Best regards,<br>
The Team behind Scope360°
